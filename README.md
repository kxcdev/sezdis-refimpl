# Reference Impl for SezDis Sealing

This repository holds the reference implementation code for
a concrete construction for the sealing scheme described in the
following paper to be presented at SCIS 2024:

SezDis Sealing: a Short, Eï¬€icient, and Zero-Storage Distributed Sealing Scheme.

## Get Started

This implementation is written in TypeScript.
You can build it with `yarn` followed by `yarn build`
(assuming you have [Yarn the package manager](https://yarnpkg.com) installed.)

You can run the included tests with `yarn jest`
(assume that you have built the project first.)

If you are hacking around, you may find `yarn dev` and `yarn verify`
particularly interesting.

## Organization

- `src/sezdis-generic.ts` implements the generic SezDis scheme
  as annotated source code. The implementation mostly
  follow the description in the paper with one noticeable difference:
  `AD.verifier` is omitted and `D.tok` is directly derived as
  `KDF(K ++ D.id ++ A.secret)`.

  This is an early variant of the scheme and does not effect the
  effectiveness nor security properties of the scheme. `AD.verifier`
  is an option feature to assist the registration process
  BEYOND what is necessary for SezDis itself, as discussed in the paper.

- `src/sezdis-416a0.ts` implements a concrete construction of the
  SezDis scheme. `416a0` signifies the fact that it's the first
  published scheme (the `a0` part) that generates 416-bits seals.

- `src/node-crypto/node-sezdes416a0-prims.ts` gives an overview of
  all crypto primitives used to implement the `416a0` concrete scheme
  of SezDis.

- `src/sezdis.test.ts` contains various tests to validate primitives
  as well as the `sezdis-416a0` implementation.
